**A Geospatial Information System**

A geospatial information system (GIS) is a computer system used to capture, store, check and display data in relation to the earth's surface.

For this project I will implement a GIS that can be used to store and display data on resources of various areas that can be used by several individuals for the purpose of planning and decision making.
